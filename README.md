# Optical_Flow_Semantics
## 1. Overview
* PMBP baseline code is mostly borrowed from [https://github.com/fbesse/pmbp](https://github.com/fbesse/pmbp) with slight modification (for compatibility with ubuntu).
* Theretically, our method *Optical flow with semantic infomation* is mostly based on the paper *[Joint Optical Flow and Temporally Consistent
Semantic Segmentation](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-46604-0_12)* with some simplification.
* Some data is remained in ./devkit
