# Optical_Flow_Semantics
## 1. Overview
* PMBP baseline code is mostly borrowed from [https://github.com/fbesse/pmbp](https://github.com/fbesse/pmbp) with slight modification (for compatibility with ubuntu).
* Theretically, our method *Optical flow with semantic infomation* is mostly based on the paper *[Joint Optical Flow and Temporally Consistent
Semantic Segmentation](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-46604-0_12)* with some simplification.
* Some data is remained in the folder ./devkit, in case someone wants to run the evaluation code directly. The running guidance can be found in [the Appendix Section of our report]()

## 2. Results

**Fl**:  Percentage ofoptical flow outliers\
**bg**: Percentage of outliers averaged onlyover background regions\
**fg**: Percentage of outliers averagedonly over foreground regions\
**all**: Percentage of outliersaveraged over all ground truth pixels\
